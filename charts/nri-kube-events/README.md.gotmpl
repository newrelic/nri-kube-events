## Values managed globally

This chart implements the [New Relic's common Helm library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/library/common-library) which
means that is has a seamless UX between things that are configurable across different Helm charts. So there are behaviours that could be
changed globally if you install this chart from `nri-bundle` or your own umbrella chart.

A really broad list of global managed values are `affinity`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, `proxy` and many more.

For more information go to the [user's guide of the common library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/library/common-library/README.md)
